I am currently a fourth-year Ph.D. Candidate of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, advised by [Prof. Yingying (Jennifer) Chen](https://www.winlab.rutgers.edu/~yychen/) (Fellow of IEEE, ACM, AAIA, NAI). I obtained my Master's degree of Computer Science at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, and Bachelor's degree of Information Security from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan. 

<font color='red'> I am on the job market in the 2024-2025 cycle, please feel free to reach out! </font>
